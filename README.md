# Movie Ticket Booking Engine (C) - SPYDAR CINEMAS

A high-performance CLI application developed in C that simulates a real-world cinema reservation system. This project demonstrates core Computer Science fundamentals, including dynamic memory management and linked list data structures.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Tiered Seating System:** Supports Gold, Silver, and Economy tiers with distinct pricing models.
* **Dynamic Data Structures:** Utilizes singly linked lists for efficient real-time seat tracking and management.
* **Automated Calculations:** Built-in logic for tax application (fixed rate) and dynamic coupon validation (CASH50, GROUP20).
* **Robust Error Handling:** Validates seat availability and tier constraints to prevent overbooking.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C
* **Concepts:** Linked Lists, Structs, Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation (`malloc`), File I/O.
